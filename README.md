# FlareBot

A cute and adorable bot used to manage Cloudflare Tunnel!

You know, so you can host your service to your friends and buddies without having to worry about sharing your IP address

Be sure to add your Discord Token and Password in .env

The password will be used to create new tunnel. (basically, a port you'd like to open)

/tunnel create localhost:8080 for example

Give it a name and description, tunnel activation requires name.

Have fun then~
